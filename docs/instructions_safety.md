### Instructions

1. **Connecting the Haxophone to Raspberry Pi:**
   Attach the haxophone to the Raspberry Pi 40-pin connector, ensuring that the USB power supply port on the Raspberry Pi faces the bottom of the haxophone, aligning with the mini-jack connector direction. Refer to the picture below for visual guidance:

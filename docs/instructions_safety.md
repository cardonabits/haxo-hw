### Instructions

1. **Connecting the Haxophone to Raspberry Pi:**
   Attach the haxophone to the Raspberry Pi 40-pin connector, ensuring that the USB power supply port on the Raspberry Pi faces the bottom of the haxophone, aligning with the mini-jack connector direction. Refer to the picture below for visual guidance:

3. **Powering Up the Haxophone:**
   Insert the USB connector into the USB power port on the Raspberry Pi to power it up.

4. **Waiting for Boot:**
   Allow the haxophone a minute to complete the boot process.

5. **Start Playing:**
   Blow air through the mouthpiece to begin playing.

### Maintenance

1. **Vent Tubes Cleaning:**
   Regularly clear the vent tubes on the haxophone by blowing dry air through them or using appropriately sized pipe cleaners.

2. **Surface Moisture Removal:**
   Use a dry cloth to wipe off any moisture that accumulates on the surface of the haxophone.

### Safety Information

1. **Proper Power Supply Connection:**
   ALWAYS power up the haxophone by connecting a USB-compliant power supply to the Raspberry Pi USB power port. Do NOT apply voltage in any other way.

2. **Mouth Insertion Warning:**
   DO NOT insert any part of the haxophone into your mouth except the tip of the neck or the mouthpiece, if you are using one.

3. **Device Condition Alert:**
   If the haxophone shows any signs of damage, emits acrid smells, or exhibits mold growth, STOP USING the device immediately for safety reasons.

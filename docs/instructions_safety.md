3. Power up Rasberry Pi by inserting USB connector into USB power port.

4. Wait for haxophone to boot (about 1 minute).

5. Blow air through the mouthpiece to start playing.

## Maintenance

1. Frequently clear the vent tubes on the haxophone by either blowing dry air through them or utilizing appropriately sized pipe cleaners.
2. Use a dry cloth to wipe off any moisture that might accumulate on the surface of the haxophone.

## Safety Information

1. ALWAYS power up the haxophone by connecting a USB-compliant power supply to the Raspberry Pi USB power port.  DO NOT apply voltage in any other way.
2. DO NOT insert any part of the haxophone into your mouth except the tip of the neck or the mouthpiece, if you are using one.
3. If the haxophone exhibits any indications of damage, acrid smells or mold growth, STOP USING the device immediately.
